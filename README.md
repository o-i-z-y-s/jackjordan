# Hello!
This is a little ocean-themed single page site I made with Vue to house my resume and say a bit about me. I stubbornly built almost everything from scratch, including the page section resizing functions and the sun/moon placement.

The background animations use [Particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js).
